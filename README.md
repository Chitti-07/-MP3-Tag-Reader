➤Objective: Developed a C-based command-line application to read and display MP3 (ID3) tag information from MP3 files.
➤ Key Features: Enabled retrieval of metadata such as title, artist, album, and genre from MP3 files, with a potential extension to modify tags in future iterations.
➤ Challenges Solved: Addressed issues in parsing ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags efficiently, ensuring compatibility with various MP3 formats and handling corrupt or unsupported files with robust error management.
➤ Libraries/Techniques Used: Utilized stdlib.h, stdio.h, and string.h for file handling and data processing; implemented bitwise operations and string parsing for accurate metadata extraction.
➤ Outcome: Delivered a user-friendly tool for managing MP3 metadata, useful for music enthusiasts and developers, with scope for future enhancements like tag editing capabilities.
